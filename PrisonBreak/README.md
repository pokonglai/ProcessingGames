PrisonBreak
===============
## Overview
The player is an escaped convict. Prison security has shut down all power in order to keep the player
locked in. This results in a pitch black prison. The prison guards are on patrol and randomly walk
around the prison. If the player is within a certain radius of a guard, they guard will be able to see
them and they chase down the player to attack them. The player must turn on the emergency power
to unlock the exit. Once the exit is unlocked the player can then use it to escape.

To turn on the emergency power the player must step on the emergency power switch. Once the
emergency power is on, emergency lights will turn on as well. If the player and a guard are both within
the spotlight produced by the emergency lights, the guard will be able to see the player, and thus
immediately chase them down, no matter the distance.

The player can see a slightly larger radius than the guards and has a flare gun which launches a
single small projectile. As the projectile travels, it will illuminate a certain radius around itself. After
one second, the projectile will explode and illuminate a large radius for two seconds. The player can
only fire the flare gun once every three seconds
