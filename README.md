ProcessingGames
===============

A collection of games built using language [processing](https://www.processing.org/).

Each game is contained inside a "main" folder. The run the games open the file "main.pde" and hit play in the IDE provided by processing.

The following libraries are used:
* **[Fisica](http://www.ricardmarxer.com/fisica/)** which is written by Richard Marxer and it is a wrapper for JBox2D which is a 2D physics engine.
* **[Path Finder](http://lagers.org.uk/pfind/index.html)** which is written by Peter Lager and it implements several graph based path finding algorithms to allow navigation in 2D and 3D.
